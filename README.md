## Activity 2 : Reflection
<strong>What did you observe about the app lifecycle when switching between screens or minimizing the app?</strong><br>

<p>
  - The app lifecycle is managed through a series of callbacks that allow the 
system to know when an app is in the foreground, background, or destroyed. 
When switching between screens, the current activity is paused and the new 
activity is resumed.</p>

<strong>What did you learn about activity management in Android?</strong><br>

<p>
  - Android is smooth user experience. It involves handling the lifecycle of 
activities, including their creation, pause, resume, and destruction. 
The setOnClickListener is similar in Web Development for the button click event.</p>
